## Module Purchase

You can see the whole list of AtroCore modules on our website: [English version](https://atropim.com/store), [German version](https://atropim.com/de/shop).

Following status options are available for each module:

* **available** – module is available for installation
* **buyable** – module should be purchased, to be able to install it

The status is changed automatically from **buyable** to **available** after the modue activation.
After you have purchased a module contact our support and provide your system IDs, which can be found on the "Administration > Settings" page. We need this ID to activate the module for your software instance. You can provide the IDs for your production, stage and testing environments.

In case of successful activation, the needed module will be switched to "available" within a few several minutes.
