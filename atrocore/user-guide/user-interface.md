# User Interface (UI)

The user interface (UI) includes all visible elements users see and interact with while using AtroCore. This article contains the overview of all the main elements of user interface, which are the same for all entities in the system, as well as gives details on how to perform common tasks or operations in the system.

> Please, make sure to contact your administrator in order to have access to a whole set of options described in this user guide.

The following elements make up the AtroCore user interface:

- [**Navigation Menu**](#navigation-menu) – to navigate through available entities.
- [**Taskbar**](#taskbar) – to help the user interact with the AtroCore system in a more efficient way; additional information or actions are displayed here. 
- [**Search and Filtering Panel**](./search-and-filtering-core.md) – to search and filter within one entity or its related entities.

Within the AtroCore system your information may be presented in various ways:

- [**List View**](./views-and-panels-core.md#list-view) – to view the lists of entity records.
- [**Detail View**](./views-and-panels-core.md#detail-view) – to view the entity record details.
- [**Create View**](./views-and-panels-core.md#create-view) – to create a new entity record in the main window.
- [**Edit View**](./views-and-panels-core.md#edit-view) – to edit the entity record.
- [**Quick Detail View (pop-up)**](./views-and-panels-core.md#quick-detail-view-small-detail-view) – to view the record details in the pop-up window.
- [**Quick Edit View (pop-up)**](./views-and-panels-core.md#quick-edit-view) – to edit the record detail in the pop-up window.
- [**Quick Create View**](./views-and-panels-core.md#quick-create-view) – to create a new entity record in the pop-up window.

## Navigation Menu

The navigation menu in the default AtroCore theme is the menu placed on the left side of your user interface. It allows you to open list views for all entities in the system.

> The navigation menu can be configured by your administrator according to your needs.

Each user can customize his/her own navigation menu in the `User Interface` section of the user ["Preferences"](#user-preferences) page:

![Navigation Menu Cfg](../_assets/user-guide/user-interface/navigation-user-cfg.jpg)

Here select the `Custom Tab List` option and add the desired tabs using the `Add` button. You can also define the tabs order via their drag-and-drop in the tab list.

## Taskbar

Taskbar is a top panel of the AtroCore user interface:

![Taskbar](../_assets/user-guide/user-interface/taskbar.jpg)

A taskbar consists of a [search](#global-search) field and some functional icons that help you work and collaborate within the AtroPIM system, namely:
- [Desktop notifications](#desktop-notifications); 
- [Queue Manager](#queue-manager);
- [Quick create](#quick-create);
- [User menu](#user-menu).

### Global Search

You can [search](./search-and-filtering-core.md) all the records existing in the AtroCore system using the global search functionality. Use the search form on the taskbar for it:

![Global Search](../_assets/user-guide/user-interface/global-search.jpg)

> The list of entities available for search is configured by the administrator in the `Administration > System > Settings > Global Search Entity List`. Please consider, only the fields configured at "Text Filter Fields" for each entity will be searched through.

Wildcards can be used for search, at any place in the search string, separately or in any combination.

| **Character**    | **Use**                                           |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| %                | Matches any number of characters, including zero  |
| _                | Matches only one character                        |

### Desktop Notifications

AtroCore uses two types of notifications: email notifications and system notifications (desktop notifications). Generally, email and desktop notifications are configured globally, for all users.

User can receive notifications in case when:

- a record is assigned to him;
- changes are made to the record he is following.

![Desktop Notifications](../_assets/user-guide/user-interface/desktop-notifications.jpg)

To view the notification details, click `View List` in the upper right corner of the `NOTIFICATIONS` panel.

### Queue Manager

Queue Manager is opened in the pop-up window for each operation executed displaying its status and a progress circle for the currently run operation:

![Queue Manager](../_assets/user-guide/user-interface/queue-manager.jpg)

In the Queue Manager pop-up, the most recent AtroCore operations, which were executed in the background mode, are displayed. Additionally, the information on the data import performed with the help of import feeds is shown in the Queue Manager pop-up. To learn more about the ["Import Feeds"](https://atropim.com/store/import-feeds) module, please, visit our store.

To view the details of the performed operations, click `View List` in the upper right corner of the Queue Manager.

### Clear Local Cache

AtroCore is a single page application (SPA). To improve the page loading time, it actively uses cache for content as well as for the user interface.

If you want to be sure in getting the latest information and application functions, please use the `Clear Local Cache` option from the user drop-down menu:

![Clear local cache option](../_assets/user-guide/user-interface/clear-local-cache-option.jpg)

## Breadcrumb Navigation

AtroCore comes with breadcrumb navigation on each page in the system. Breadcrumb navigation is a form of a path-style clickable navigation, which links the user back to the prior website page in the overall online route. It reveals the path the user took to arrive to the given page. The `>` symbol separates out the hierarchical search order from beginning to end and may look something like:
`Home Page > Section Page > Subsection Page`.
